# Card Form

In this project i developed a form that fills in the data of a card, like a card number, card name, card date and card cvc. The form has been validated, so, if you try fill in an invalid card number or cvc, you will get an error. When you click the confirm button you will get a message saying that your card details have been added successfully.
